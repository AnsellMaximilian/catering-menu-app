# Catering Menu Creation App

A React application that pulls in food (dishes) data from a headless CMS Contentful API and displays them on a webpage. The user can then build a menu of dishes for each day from Monday to Friday. The finished menu will be able to be printed and downloaded as a picture.

## REQUIREMENTS

User can:

- Browse a list of avalable dishes.
- See details of each dish. (recipe, ingredients, etc.)
- Assign and remove dishes to and from each day of a period, which creates the whole menu for that period.
- Display the menu for a period (this includes the dishes for each day, dates, and other relevant information).
- Download an image of the menu of a period.
